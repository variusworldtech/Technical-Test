# Part 1 - Some code

Solidity and most other smart contract languages are deterministic. Sometimes they need data that is outside of the blockchain.

One of the ways Ethereum has dealt with this issue is by offering oracle services. 

A popular one is Oraclize another is TinyOracle. Both will work well for this task.


You will need to use one of the oracle services to connect to the following JSON file.

[Casino.json](https://variusworldtech.github.io/Technical-Test/casino.json)

You will need to retrieve the list of casino games from the API using oraclise.

The smart contract should store this list of games.
Only the owner of the contract can call this function.


# Part 2 - Some pictures

Please draw up a basic diagram of how you might model a flow for a system where there is a wallet that also acts as a single sign on mechanism to multiple casinos.  For example, like login with facebook.

How can this work with a user's wallet on the blockchain instead of a standard centralised web app with database.


There are no right or wrong answers to this test and the purspose is to serve as a tool for discussion.


*Aim　to spend 1-2 hours on these tasks.  There is no need to produce perfect answers.*
